## Introduction

As someone who:

* Is a trail runner who loves the outdoors and appreciates ultralight gear
* Likes to one-bag travel with just a single backpack for urban travel
* Already owns two Gossamer Gear packs
    * I use the [Vagabond Jet](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/vagabond-jet) for my daily EDC + commute bag and the [Gorilla 50 Ultralight Backpack](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/gorilla-50) for multi-day outdoor expeditions

...I have been waiting for something like Gossamer Gear's Travel Collection; a one-bag-travel oriented collection of gear that embodies Gossamer Gear's philosophy of "Take less, do more".

Gossamer Gear's Travel Collection is set for a global release on 2025-05-06, and Gossamer Gear was nice enough to send me pre-release testing samples of their upcoming Travel collection for testing and review. Although the products were sent by Gossamer Gear, the company had no inputs on my opinions.

Below are some pictures and my initial impressions of the collection.

## Travel bags

### Aero Jet Backpack

#### Summary

The Aero Jet Backpack is the main bag of the collection: a clam-shell stype travel backpack that focuses on minimizing weight without sacrificing function.

The main specs of the Aero Jet backpack:

| category | value |
| -- | -- |
| volume | 35L (excluding exterior stretch pockets)
| weight | 1.13kg (40 oz.) |
| dimensions (W x H x D) |31.1x52.7x19.1 cm (12.25x20.75x7.5 in) |

The main highlights of the pack are:

* Extremely comfortable harness system with sternum strap and optional hip belt
* Zippered mesh interior with clam-style opening
* One of THE best tech compartments, with holders for a laptop and tablet and a small mesh pocket with a discreet AirTag pocket
* Front stretch mesh pocket
* Dual water bottle pockets
* Hidden pocket with RFID-blocking
* Luggage pass-through

#### Comparments

The Aero Jet has the following compartments:

1. Main compartment
    1. Inner front panel with two large zippered mesh pockets
    2. Main compartment
2. Tech compartment with separate laptop and tablet holder and small mesh pocket
3. Front zippered pocket
4. Front stretch mesh pocket
5. Dual watter bottle pockets
6. Hidden pocket
7. Two stretch mesh pockets on each of the shoulder straps

The main compartment is spacious, and fits the Jet Pack Compression Cubes perfectly:

The pack packed out with the Jet Pack Compression Cubes and Dirty/Clean Cube with about a week's worth of clothes, plus an empty Clear Cube:

The pack's tech compartment is top notch, just like the Vagabond's:

The tech compartment's zipper mesh pocket has a discrete AirTag pocket:

The tech compartment is heavily padded, and is balanced out well. It also has a bit of a false bottom, and that coupled with its padded protection, I have no fear of my laptop and tablet getting damaged. 

After having used the Vagabond Jet as my main commute and EDC bag for more than a year, Gossamer Gear's interpretation of the tech compartment has become one of my favorites. Nothing super fancy, but it completely nails the essentials of protection and weight distribution while being lightweight.

The front stretch mesh pocket is one of my favorite features of my Vagabond Jet, and I'm happy to see it also on the Aero Jet. It's such a convenient location to quickly stash and retrieve low-value items like snacks and tissues. I also like the mesh pockets on the shoulder straps, which I frequently use for holding my Bluetooth earbuds and phone (Pixel 8).

#### Fit and comfort

Like other travel backpacks with similar capacity, the pack is large, and will not make for a good daypack (Fortuantely, Gossamer Gear has an answer for that - read on below). Here's how the pack looks on me (173cm / 5'6"):

Despite its size, it is an extremely comfortable carry. Gossamer Gear's years of experience of making ultralight outdoor gear shines through in its harness system, and the pack does not dig in at all on the shoulders or on the back.

It is also compatible with the optional [Fastbelt](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/fast-belt) hipbelt, which will help even more with weight distribution while adding some storage. My Fastbelt is on the way, so I haven't had the chance to try out the Aero Jet with the hip belt. Although the pack wasn't fully loaded out, the pack is already supremely comfortable, and I look forward to trying out the Fastbelt with the pack when it arrives.

#### Miscellaneous

The sternum strap is a simple, no-frills buckle-style strap. It's easily height-adjustable, and although I do enjoy the magnetic sternum straps of my other travel backpack (Heimplanet Transit 34L), I also appreciate the lightweight and simple strap of the Aero Jet.

The side hadle is well-padded and is comfortable to hold. The top handle is identical to that of the Vagabond Jet - secure stitching with a rounded handle that doesn't dig in to your hands while holding it up.

The straps don't come with any fasteners and will dangle out-of-the-box, which is not great. However, I always keep a roll of velcro cable ties around for packs like this, and the loose straps can easily be tidied up with them.

The luggage pass-through is extremely appreciated, and I like how it allows you to sit the bag up straight on a roller suitcase instead of having to lay it down on its side, like on some other packs. 

The hidden security pocket on the back with RFID-blocking is also a great touch and makes for the perfect compartment for your passport while traveling.

Double water-bottle pockets are a must for me, as I always have a 750ml water bottle pocket with me at all times. The extra pocket is often used to hold my daughter's smaller water bottle, or an umbrella on rainy days.

The zippers to the tech compartment and front zippered pocket are aquaguarded, but the zippers of the main compartment are not. They also are not YKK-branded zippers, but they open and close just fine, and I have yet to have any zipper failures on any of my multiple Gossamer Gear products.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the pack is quite minimal and doesn't come with many of creature comforts found in other high-end travel packs such as magnetic straps, stretchy mesh pockets or an advanced admin pocket. But for someone who values simplicity, it feels like a very Gossamer Gear-esque interpretation of the travel backpack, and as a long-time fan of their products, I feel right at home. I love the minimal design language of the pack that still retains the key features that make a good one-bag travel pack, while keeping the pack's base weight to a respectable 1.13 kg.

### RikSak 22L Packable Backpack

The RikSak is a 22L packable backpack that can be used as an ultralight daypack (the answer to the Aero Jet being too big for a daypack) that packs down to a small pocket that fits in the palm of your hand.
